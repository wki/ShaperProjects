# My Shaper Projects

This repository contains various small projects I created for the 
Shaper Origin CNC Mill. Most projects were edited using Affinity Designer
and then exported to SVG. If necessary, the SVG files have been annotated
as described in [1]. Before using Affinity Designer it makes sense to
import the color-coding styles from [2]. Additionally, they recommend
to use the settings from [3] when exporting a drawing as SVG.
