# My Shaper Projects

This repository contains various small projects I created for the 
Shaper Origin CNC Mill. Most projects were edited using Affinity Designer
and then exported to SVG. If necessary, the SVG files have been annotated
as described in [1]. Before using Affinity Designer it makes sense to
import the color-coding styles from [2]. Additionally, they recommend
to use the settings from [3] when exporting a drawing as SVG.

Projects:

 * French Cleat
   Some shapes usable for french cleat attachments.
   Will be expanded as my progress evolves.

 * Puzzle
   4 parts able to stick together as a puzzle (still not working).

 * Puzzle_Connection
   A lap-joint like connection with a round shape like a puzzle.
   Currently drawn for wood stipes with 45mm width and 20mm thickness.
   Each radius in the drawing is 8mm min, the bit diameter is designed to be 6mm.
   A custom reference point is in the middle axis of the shape at the border
   helps placing the individual shapes properly if a grid is defined where the
   wood stipes are aligned at.

 * Flat_clamp_19mm
   a clamping mechanism with a 19mm hole in the middle to allow clamping
   pieces on a surface with 19mm holes.
